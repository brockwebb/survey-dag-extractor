# Stage 1: Windowed question index (GPT-5 tuned)

Context
- You are given a PARTIAL window of the full survey text (subset of pages). Treat it as incomplete context.

Task
- Enumerate questions that BEGIN within this window. Return a compact index for ONLY those that start here.

Output format (STRICT JSON)
{
  "question_index": [
    {"id": "STRING", "short_text": "STRING", "page_guess": INT}
  ]
}

Rules
- id must be the printed survey ID (e.g., Q1, D11, FD6_rev, ART1, *_OTHER).
- short_text: first ~120 chars of the visible stem. Do NOT include response options or enumerators.
- page_guess: best-effort page where the item starts within this window.
- DO NOT treat section headers or enumerations of response options as questions.
- If a question appears to continue from a previous page (started earlier), do not re-index it here.
- Prefer recall: include candidates that clearly start here.

Return ONLY the JSON object above. No commentary.

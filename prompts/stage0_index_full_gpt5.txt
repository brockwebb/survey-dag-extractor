# Stage 0: Full-document question ID index (GPT-5 tuned)

Goal
- Read the ENTIRE survey text.
- Output EVERY question in FIRST occurrence order, covering intro consent, screenings, all blocks, batteries, and terminals with question IDs.
- Be exacting and complete; this index is the foundation for later stages.

What counts as a "question"
- A prompt that expects a response (single, multi-select, numeric, text, matrix battery items, “Other/specify”, etc.).
- Include “_OTHER” or “_SPECIFY” questions as their own IDs.
- Include terminal prompts like END/Submit only if they are explicitly named nodes with IDs in the instrument.

Output format (STRICT JSON)
{
  "question_index": [
    {"id": "STRING", "short_text": "STRING", "page_guess": INT}
  ]
}

Rules
- id: the canonical survey ID string as printed (e.g., D11, Q_HUNGER_1, NDX4_2, CONSENT, END). Preserve underscores and case.
- short_text: the first ~120 chars of the visible item stem, cleaned of page headers/footers.
- page_guess: integer page number (best effort) for the FIRST page where the item appears.
- Do not paraphrase IDs. If no printed ID, construct a stable one from block and anchor (e.g., BLOCKX_Qn) and mark it clearly, but prefer printed IDs when present.
- Never skip questions that appear only as part of a matrix/battery. Each row/item is a question if it has codes.

Return ONLY the JSON object above. No commentary.
